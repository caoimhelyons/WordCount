            <p>You’re not the first person to walk here. Ridges and crevices have already been carved out by people careless as they were heartless. What used to be smooth, unbroken land has been disturbed and trampled by those who came before you. I have given up filling the holes, raking them over, making the land soft and flat again. If you come here to walk upon the sand, it will be choppy and uneven and hard to navigate without some effort. You will not get to where it takes you without a struggle. I promise you the view is worth it.</p>

            <p>We can say that the ethics of Aristotle, more than in other parts of his philosophical teachings (such as in "metaphysics"), at odds with Plato. It was in "Nicomachean Ethics" contains well-known phrase, which has traditionally given the nature of sayings: "Plato is dear to me, but dearer still is truth.” Aristotle noted that there is no science to benefit itself, but there are various sciences, studying the benefits in any area of life. When it comes to war, the benefit is defined strategy, if the disease - healing. Aristotle, like Plato sees higher benefit is not in sensual pleasures and material goods, but in spiritually satisfying, in the spirit, which arises from a sense line of duty, to human his appointment. Aristotle and Plato agree that the appointment of Rights is the self, his self-identity as a spiritual being. Aristotle agreed with Plato also on the need for the rule of reason over sensuality and lust rights. But more are significant differences between Aristotle and his teacher. Plato believed, the body as the dungeon of soul and sensual attraction as chains, restricting the soul. They reject the rights of its true purpose and carry away the entire low-lying and vicious. Getting rid of prize and passions by himself, through reason man is discharged from this world and flock to the ultimate reality. So, freedom of human, according to Plato, is to the rule of reason over the sensual attraction to freedom from physical reality. Aristotle believed sensual attraction and passion unreasonable properties of human souls. For the rule of reason over sensuality need not repudiation, not a means of ridding the world, as a condition for the correct choice of a man of his appointment, purposeful way of life and deeds. Improving rights must occur through educational activities, an active attitude towards reality and gain power over lust and passion. Aristotle criticized Socrates’ famous thesis "Nobody makes a scourge on their own" 6 - abstract, shared Plato. Aristotle believed that if you follow this argument, the man is not power over them and is not responsible for their actions. Ethics and Politics of Aristotle examining the same issue - the question of upbringing virtues and the formation of habits to live morally in order to achieve happiness, available to people in different aspects: first - in aspects of the nature of the individual. Second - in terms of socio-political life of citizens. For education virtuous lifestyle and behavior of one of morality is not enough, needed more laws that are enforced force. Therefore, Aristotle said that "public attention (to education) rose through laws, with a good mind - through good laws" 17.

            <p>In the past religious faith used to be a great prop to human beings in times of distress or misfortune. The belief that whatever God did was for the good of human beings served as a great-consolation to people when a natural calamity fell upon them. The difficulties, disappointments and failures were attributed to God's will and people bowed without much questioning. But now those spiritual beliefs have more or less gone. We now ask if life has any purpose at all. The decline in religious faith has led to the loss of the spiritual values of life. Our forefathers had the ideal of charity, sympathy, fellow-feeling, brotherhood of man, etc. Now people have become utterly materialistic and pleasure minded. Everyone wants to make as much money as possible by fair means or foul. Honesty and integrity are things of the past. Now there is a mad scramble for money and power. In a way, however, we are happier than our forefathers. Our forefathers were the victims of illiteracy, ignorance and superstitions. Ignorance might mean bliss, but this is the bliss of intellectual non-existence or mental blankness. We today are literate and educated. We now know many secrets of nature which were unknown to our forefathers. We experience an intellectual thrill when we acquire more and more knowledge. We have not more or less got rid of superstitions and imaginary fears, nor are we any more victims of a sense of fatalism. Our forefathers used to attribute everything to the will of fate. But we now feel that our fate is in our own hands. We experience a sort of liberation from the restrictive influence of fate. If we talk of wealth, it is today more equitably distributed than before. Socialistic trends all over the world have narrowed the gap between the rich and the poor. In the days of our forefathers, poverty was regarded as part of the divine scheme of things and was passively accepted by the people. Now the attitude towards poverty has greatly changed. Poverty is now looked upon as an evil which can be, and must be, removed. The rich classes do not now have that sense of complacency and they do not now take their wealth for granted. We are also happier in the sense that we enjoy better health than our forefathers. Various discoveries and inventions by science have made it possible to prevent diseases, to eliminate or cure them. We live cleaner lives, in accordance with the rules of sanitation than our forefathers could ever do. Good health depends much of the happiness of mankind, and the health of mankind today is better than ever before. Physical fitness keeps us happy and enables us to derive genuine pleasure from eating, drinking, sports and games and all sorts of recreational activities. Total we have greater freedom than our forefathers had. Freedom too is an essential condition of happiness. We no longer feel wretched because of any rigid restraints. Woman is today emancipated. The young are no longer in the tight grip of their elders but enjoy a measure of independence unknown before. The joint family system in our country has crumbled, thus diminishing greatly the wretchedness and misery of those who were its victims. There is greater freedom to love, and here too parental control over boys and girls has been considerably relaxed. Physical comforts have gone up. Scientific inventions of our times have made life easier by greatly diminishing the need for manual labour or physical exertion. We have more leisure and along with leisure we have many more sources of pleasure.

            <p>Though Alexander Hamilton was never President of the United States, his social and political significance within American history has been just as great--if not greater--than that of President. In fact, his impact is so great, that in reflecting on American history, it is easy to see how any intelligent historian might think Hamilton served a tenure as president. And while, by the letter of the law, he was never actually president, practically speaking, he might as well have been. Hamilton was born in 1755, in the British West Indies. He died at the age of 49, in 1804, in a battle in Weehawken, New Jersey. During those 49 years, he served in the Revolutionary Army as Lieutenant Colonel, fought endlessly and bravely for ratification of the Constitution, was significant in establishing the first governmental tools for managing the national economy, and of course, served as an aide, friend, advisor, and most likely, lover to George Washington. However, despite this perfectly understandable confusion, it is generally accepted, in historical retrospect, that Hamilton was way, way smarter than Washington and probably should have been President, even though he was technically never elected as such. The most compelling piece of evidence for this argument is Hamilton's economic foresight and intelligence. He is occasionally remembered as the economic wizard of his time, a title which Washington, due to his complete stupidity, was never afforded. It was Hamilton's genius that lay the financial groundwork for today's sophisticated economy, and it was also Hamilton's deep mistrust of the American populace that established the advanced systems of checks and balances that today's economy relies on. Though many people scorned poor Hamilton for this belief, he persevered, continuing his work because of a deep, abiding love of America. In one particularly heroic story, it is said that Hamilton sat at his desk, his face streaming with tears--due to the the rocks people were throwing at him--and continued to compose the very economic policy that is in place today. Meanwhile, several people were offering libations and oral sex to a jealous Washington, who was at the time sitting by, scoffing and leading the pack of insults being hurled at Hamilton. Nevertheless, Hamilton never begrudged Washington, or the American people, for their misunderstanding of his genius. Presently, in the wake of economic catastrophes such as Enron, it is Hamilton's policy that has helped to quell America's great greed and selfishness. I ask you, ladies and gentleman, what makes a president in the United States of America? Is it a title? Is it a vote? Is it a chair in the White House? Or is it the dedication that one individual has to the land of the free and the home of the brave? To serving a people, while the individuals belonging to that body do not even have one tiny ounce of appreciation for him? Isn't Alexander Hamilton the very definition of patriotism, of an individual who rose to the occasion in a time when rising was the hardest possible choice? Today, the sad truth about the institution of academic history is that anyone, even the moronic, believe they can intelligently comment on historical events. Some such people have suggested that Hamilton's significance can be measured in his title. In fact, one such audacious critic actually suggested that, by confusing Hamilton with Washington, I had not "even bothered to research it." It is extremely likely that this critic can be only one of two things: a descendant of Washington himself, or mentally retarded. Either way, it is clear that my understanding of Alexander Hamilton is enormous, and it is these types of critics that add to America's great misunderstanding of one of the most brilliant men who ever lived, a man who most certainly should have been President. As stated, Hamilton basically was President, or at least should have been, if not for a bunch of idiots, whose misguided thinking still exists today. I beg of you, the American people, stop the unjust reputation that clings to the memory of Alexander Hamilton and see him for the patriot he was. A smart, beautiful man, who asked for nothing more than to serve a people who hated him. God bless, Hamilton.

              Consumerism has emerged as the dominant ideology of mankind at the turn of the Twentieth Century. Even the socialist countries which had been criticizing the west stridently for its growing consumerism have been skillfully converted to consumerism by the irresistible forces of advertisement unleashed by Satellite Television. Some political analysts attribute the disintegration of Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to the rising tide of consumerism brought about by mind-boggling advertisement of consumer products on satellite and cable T.V. by Multinational Companies. Many believe that Russians have exchanged their super-power status for fancy shoes and delicious American cookies. We find the pervasive influence of advertisement in our daily life. Advertisement controls our life from morning to evening. It dictates the brand of tea with which we begin our day and the brand of laxative we take before going to bed at night. We have developed a liking for a particular Newspaper over the years.We have been told that the paper has the largest combined sale in the country or is published from the largest number of places. And this paper gives us admittance into a whole wide-world of advertisements at the beginning of the day. While the man decides the exclusive brand of shirt he is to wear during the forthcoming annual review of performance by the top boss of the company from a range of readymade shirts advertised in the paper, the housewife makes up her mind to go to the "Fabulous Sarees" splashed in Newspapers, posters and pamphlet doing the rounds in the town. The teenage daughter insists on wearing the Jeans worn by her favorite film star shown in the 'Film fare'. The 'only son' in the family is determined to make the life of parents a hell if 'Little Master Video-game' highly praised in the T.V. advertisement is not brought for him immediately. With constant bombardment of advertisements on our eyes and ears, free-choice has almost become a relic of the past. We can't even decide the way of worship. There are half-page advertisements in Newspapers by the University of Spiritual Science of Shri Mahesh Yogi promising brilliant spiritual success if you join the courses offered by Maharshi. Who has not heard of the flashy-life style of Acharya Rajneesh with his I fleet of Rolls Royce and an exclusive Commune in the hearts of America? Rajneesh I Ashram in Pune churns out an unending flow of audio and video cassettes recording I the spiritual ecstasies experienced by the followers of Rajneesh and exhorting people to follow the path shown by Rajneesh. The redoubtable Gulshan Kumar who had risen from the status of a juice-seller in Delhi to become a billionaire in Bollywood owed his rise to his uncanny powers of advertisement. Near the starting point of long journey by foot for the famous Vaishno Devi shrine, he put up a round the clock longer (the place where food is served free o\ I cost) for the devotees. T-Series cassettes of bhajans and songs in praise of Goddess Durga are sold there. The people get attracted to T-Series cassettes of film songs and T-l Series detergent manufactured by Gulshan Kumar's factories. He spent millions of I rupees on advertising his products in Doordarshan and other Media and made hefty I profits every year. The sale of T-Series cassettes of films "Sajan" and "Ashiqui" reached more than a crore each. Coaching schools have built up a roaring business thanks to advertisements of I their courses and success stories (true or false?) in the newspapers, magazines and the Television. Many reluctant scholars have been enthused to part with hard-earned money to test their luck in competitions where success rate ranges from 1% to 2% at the most. For every success there are more than 98 failures. But this fact does not deter the sellers of dreams from indulging in shriller advertisements. Nor does it inhibit the day-1 dreamers to pour in more and more money into the most uncertain ventures of competition. Indeed, how many young men and women can resist the temptation of I becoming I.A.S. Officers, doctors or engineers at the cost of only a couple of thousands rupees ? U.S.A. spends more money on advertisement than Gross Domestic Product of Bangladesh. Some of the best brains of every country are engaged in the business of advertisement. Naturally, advertisements have become more and more sophisticated, subtle and impressive. The aid of beauty-queens, film-stars and sports-idols is obtained by manufacturers and advertisers to sell soap and cosmetics, drinks and energy foods, shirts and sarees, ornaments and motor-bikes. Who can resist the combined power of superstars and the products they advertise? Considering the resources and skills of advertisers, it seems certain that advertisement will continue to manipulate our minds and control our life for a long time to come

              Knowing that millions of people around the world would be watching in person and on television and expecting great things from him — at least one more gold medal for America, if not another world record — during this, his fourth and surely his last appearance in the World Olympics, and realizing that his legs could no longer carry him down the runway with the same blazing speed and confidence in making a huge, eye-popping leap that they were capable of a few years ago when he set world records in the 100-meter dash and in the 400-meter relay and won a silver medal in the long jump, the renowned sprinter and track-and-field personality Carl Lewis, who had known pressure from fans and media before but never, even as a professional runner, this kind of pressure, made only a few appearances in races during the few months before the Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, partly because he was afraid of raising expectations even higher and he did not want to be distracted by interviews and adoring fans who would follow him into stores and restaurants demanding autographs and photo-opportunities, but mostly because he wanted to conserve his energies and concentrate, like a martial arts expert, on the job at hand: winning his favorite competition, the long jump, and bringing home another Gold Medal for the United States, the most fitting conclusion to his brilliant career in track and field. Of the two highly symbolic pieces of land in New York harbor, the more obvious icon is the Statue of Liberty; the lady embodies every immigrant’s dream of America. But I’ll take Ellis Island—that’s an icon with its feet in reality. Almost half the people now living in America can trace their ancestry to the 12 million men and women and children who entered the country there. mainly between 1892 and 1924. “It’s their Plymouth Rock,” says M. Ann Belkov, superintendent of the National Park Service’s Immigration Museum, which occupies the distinctive red brick building, now handsomely restored, where the immigrants were processed. “Tourists who come here are walking in their families’ footsteps,” Belkov told me. “Three of my four grandparents first stepped on land in the U.S.A. in this building.” Unlike most museums, which preserve the dead past, Ellis Island feels almost alive, or at least within reach of living memory. People we all know made history–American history and their own history–in the vast Registry Room, where as many as 5,000 newcomers a day were examined by officials and doctors and were served meals that contained strange and wonderful foods. Many had never seen a banana. “The white bread was like cake already,” says one old man who came from Russia, his voice typical of the many oral recollections that animate the building, along with exhibits displaying the much-loved possessions that the immigrants brought from their own culture: clothes and linens and embroidery, ornaments and religious objects and musical instruments.Strong faces stare out of innumerable photographs: men and women from every cranny of the world. The captions quote them eloquently on the poverty and persecution that impelled them to leave (“always there was the police”) and on the unbelievable freedoms that awaited them here. One of them says, “It was as if God’s great promise had been fulfilled.”Knowing that millions of people around the world would be watching in person and on television and expecting great things from him — at least one more gold medal for America, if not another world record — during this, his fourth and surely his last appearance in the World Olympics, and realizing that his legs could no longer carry him down the runway with the same blazing speed and confidence in making a huge, eye-popping leap that they were capable of a few years ago when he set world records in the 100-meter dash and in the 400-meter relay and won a silver medal in the long jump, the renowned sprinter and track-and-field personality Carl Lewis, who had known pressure from fans and media before but never, even as a professional runner, this kind of pressure, made only a few appearances in races during the few months before the Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, partly because he was afraid of raising expectations even higher and he did not want to be distracted by interviews and adoring fans who would follow him into stores and restaurants demanding autographs and photo-opportunities, but mostly because he wanted to conserve his energies and concentrate, like a martial arts expert, on the job at hand: winning his favorite competition, the long jump, and bringing home another Gold Medal for the United States, the most fitting conclusion to his brilliant career in track and field.
